Spend time with loved ones
Travel to a place I've always wanted to visit
Write letters to my family and friends
Eat my favorite foods
Watch the sunrise or sunset
Go on a hot air balloon ride
Learn to play a new instrument
Have a picnic in a beautiful park
Go skydiving
Take a relaxing bath",
Read a book I've been meaning to read
Watch my favorite movie
Listen to my favorite music
Take a nap in a hammock
Go on a hike
Have a meaningful conversation with someone
Learn a new skill or hobby
Give back to the community
Attend a music festival
Go to a comedy club
Try a new cuisine
eat an pineapple
read 1984
Take a walk
enjoy the last sunset
